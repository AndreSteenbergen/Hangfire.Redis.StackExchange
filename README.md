# Hangfire.Redis.StackExchange
HangFire Redis storage based on original (and now unsupported) Hangfire.Redis but using lovely StackExchange.Redis client

This project is based upon https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire.Redis/.
Unfortunately that project get abandoned due to [switch to pro version](http://odinserj.net/2014/11/15/hangfire-pro/) and it doesn't work anymore with the new version.
